<h1>‘I create better experiences for <del>users</del>, <span class="highlight">People</span>’.</h1>
    <p>
      I have always been passionate about art and its ability to convey meaning while solving problems. Alongside my interest in different mediums of art, I also studied business, expanding my knowledge of the professional world. During my time as an undergraduate student, I became fascinated with understanding people's motivations, emotions, and how their environment influences them. This led me to explore the field of UX/UI design, where I could combine my strategic skills with my creativity. My objective is to merge my artistic abilities and strategic thinking in every project I undertake. Whether it's developing an app, redesigning a website, or creating a brand identity, I strive to create user experiences that seamlessly blend art and strategy.

      In addition to my passion for traveling and drawing inspiration from the intricate designs found in various corners of the world, I indulge in baking delectable cakes to fuel my creativity. On alternate days, I channel my artistic flair into crafting mesmerizing 3D illustrations. I have a natural inclination towards maintaining a well-organized lifestyle, and I also enjoy sharing my experiences as a vlogger.
